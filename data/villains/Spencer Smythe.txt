'''Spencer Smythe''' ({{IPAc-en|s|m|aɪ|ð}}) is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. A scientist researching [[robotics]] and [[Arachnid|arachnids]], he turned to crime to finance his research, and dedicated his life to capturing Spider-Man. Smythe is best known for creating the [[Spider-Slayer|Spider-Slayers]], robots designed specifically to hunt down, capture, or kill the web-slinger. He is also the father of [[Alistair Smythe]], who inherited Spencer's creations and hatred for Spider-Man after his death.

The character has appeared in several Spider-Man adaptations, including animated series and video games.

==Publication history==
Spencer Smythe and the Spider-Slayers first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #25 (June 1965) and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=338}}</ref> Spencer died in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #192 (May 1979).

==Fictional character biography==
Professor Spencer Smythe was an expert in robotics and arachnids who asked [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to fund his projects, having been convinced by Jameson's editorials that [[Spider-Man]] was a menace. After watching a demonstration showing that Smythe's robot could sense and track spiders, Jameson hired Smythe to capture Spider-Man. Jameson himself controlled the robot, meaning that Spider-Man was chased by a machine with Jameson's face. However, the web-slinger escaped by leaving the Spider-Man suit wrapped in the robot's tentacles.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #105</ref>

Annoyed at his robot's inability to capture Spider-Man, Smythe began to obsess about the web-slinger, turning to crime to finance his research and constantly improving his robots which he dubbed [[Spider-Slayer]]s.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #106-107</ref><ref>{{cite book |last =Rovin |first =Jeff |title =The Encyclopedia of Supervillains |publisher =Facts on File |date =1987 |location =New York |isbn = 0-8160-1356-X |page=6}}</ref> But his creations, no matter how deadly or powerful he made, were always defeated by Spider-Man utilizing a key flaw in their designs.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #107</ref>

Eventually, Smythe's criminal career came to an end when the radioactive materials used in the robots' manufacture poisoned him, dooming him to a slow and agonizing death.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #186</ref> Blaming Spider-Man and Jameson equally for his impending demise, Smythe handcuffed the two together with a bomb scheduled to detonate in 24 hours, determined to make the two suffer the agony of inescapable death that he saw the two as having condemned him to.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #190</ref> Unfortunately for Smythe, his disease was too advanced for him to survive the 24 hours himself, and he died convinced that he had killed off the two responsible. Peter Parker, however, had a pretty good grasp of what made mechanical devices tick, and was able to abort the bomb by freezing its controls mere moments before it would have detonated.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #192</ref>

After Spencer's death, his son [[Alistair Smythe]] inherited the Spider-Slayer legacy.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Annual 19</ref>

During the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, Spencer Smythe is cloned by [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Miles Warren]]'s company New U Technologies.<ref>''Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref>
