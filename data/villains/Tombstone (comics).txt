'''Tombstone''' ('''Lonnie Thompson Lincoln''') is a fictional [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Depicted as a hulking [[albino]] man with filed teeth, Tombstone is a notorious crime boss in [[New York City]]. He is primarily an enemy of [[Spider-Man]] and [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], and the father of [[Janice Lincoln]].

The character has appeared in several media adaptations outside of comics over the years, including animated series and video games. Tombstone made his cinematic debut in the 2018 animated film, ''[[Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse]]'', voiced [[Krondon|Marvin "Krondon" Jones III]].

==Publication history==

The character was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[Alex Saviuk]] and first appeared in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #36 (March 1988).<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=383}}</ref> The character was immediately established to have a history with longtime Spider-Man [[supporting character]] [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], and was brought on as a regular in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', which was then being written by Conway. Conway explained why he created Tombstone: "My general motivation was a need to work with the characters who weren't central to ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' title, since that was the main book. That meant I needed to focus my attention not on [[Aunt May]] or [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]], or even [[J. Jonah Jameson]], but on second- or even third-tier supporting characters. Joe Robertson was one of those. The second motive had to do with my desire to bring back the ruthless gangster [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] had been, but not Hammerhead himself. It just came to me as a character type. One thing led to another, and as his backstory expanded, readers responded well to it."<ref>{{cite journal|last= Williams|first= Scott E.|date= October 2010|title= Gerry Conway: Everything but the Gwen Stacy Sink|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 44| page= 17|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Born as Lonnie Thompson Lincoln in [[Harlem]], in [[New York City]], he started out as troubled youth who was bullied by his peers because he was Harlem's only [[African Americans|African-American]] [[Albinism|albino]]. Taller and stronger than the other children, he became a school bully, extorting [[protection money]] from his classmates. The school newspaper, edited by [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Joseph "Robbie" Robertson]], was going to run a story on Lonnie's activities, but pulled it when Lonnie used scare tactics to intimidate Robertson. Lonnie allowed his personal demons to direct the course of his life and he turned to a life of serious crime.{{issue|date=December 2017}} As a [[hitman]] and enforcer, he used his albinism to his advantage. He filed his teeth and nails to points, giving him the appearance of a [[vampire]]. This frequently caught his opponents off-guard, making it easier to kill them. He also lifted weights and engaged in many street fights to hone his fighting skills. One night, Robertson, now working for a local paper, went to meet a source only to see the source being killed by Lincoln. He threatened to kill Robertson if the story was brought out. Robertson kept the secret for over twenty years whilst Lincoln became a powerful mob enforcer, killing many others.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #137. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Now known as "Tombstone" on the street, he returned to New York City as the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s hitman.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #36.

Robertson was also incarcerated for suppression of evidence. On learning this, Tombstone obtained a transfer to Lewsiburg State Penitentiary where Robertson was incarcerated. In prison, Tombstone killed Robertson's befriended bodyguard Bruiser. Tombstone eventually broke out of prison but was confronted by [[Spider-Man]]; he eluded capture after a harrowing battle in which he nearly beat Spider-Man to death before Robertson stopped him. Tombstone and Robertson were knocked into the Susquehana River.  Tombstone brought a badly-injured Robertson to an Amish family so that Robertson could recover enough to give him a decent fight. When Tombstone finally made his move to kill Robertson in retaliation for turning on him during the fight with Spider-Man, Robertson stabbed Tombstone with a pitchfork and then escaped. Tombstone joined a criminal organization, headed by [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], and then saved Robertson from Hobgoblin so that he could kill Robertson himself.<ref>''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #150, 153, 155, 157, 161.

Tombstone eventually gained a [[superhuman]] physical constitution. Tombstone encountered Robertson at the Osborn Chemical Plant. Robertson shot Tombstone and trapped him in an airtight test chamber which contained an experimental gas. The gas was absorbed into Tombstone's bloodstream and had a mutagenic effect on his body, enhancing his strength and heightening his other physical abilities. Tombstone then called off his vendetta against Robertson in gratitude.<ref>''Web of Spider-Man'' #66-68.

==Powers and abilities==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}
Originally, Lonnie Lincoln had no superhuman powers, but has gained them through artificial means as a result of a mutagenic reaction to an experimental preservative gas absorbed into his bloodstream. He possesses physical strength that has been increased beyond his original limits to superhuman levels. Tombstone's body is highly resistant to physical injury and is capable of withstanding extreme temperatures, great impact forces, high caliber bullets and toxic gases without sustaining injury. His reflexes, speed, and stamina are likewise heightened beyond a range attainable for normal human beings.

Aside from these advantages, he is an excellent hand-to-hand combatant with years of street fighting experience and, even before gaining powers, was easily capable of killing someone with his bare hands. He now combines his street-fighting skills with his superhuman strength to create a unique fighting style. He is also highly proficient with conventional firearms and well connected in the underworld of organized crime.

As an albino, Tombstone is sensitive to sunlight due to a natural deficiency of [[melanin]]. He is usually depicted as only being capable of speaking in whispers. However, after the exposure to gas at OsCorp, he has been depicted speaking in tones approaching normal vocal tones.

Tombstone has filed all his teeth into razor-sharp points.

When Tombstone met the Blue Spider-Girl, he revealed to her that he killed the other Spider-Girl, which caused her to attack him in rage.
