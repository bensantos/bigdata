'''Overdrive''' ('''James Beverley''') is a [[Fictional character|fictional]] [[villain]], appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]].

==Publication history==
Created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[Phil Jimenez]], Overdrive first appeared in ''Amazing Spider-Man: Swing Shift'' (May 2007), a [[Free Comic Book Day]] issue set after the events of the ''[[Spider-Man: One More Day]]'' storyline.

Something of a throwaway joke character, Overdrive made a few inconsequential appearances throughout Dan Slott's run on ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]''. As part of [[Marvel NOW!]] and the ''[[Superior Spider-Man]]'' relaunch, Overdrive joined the [[Sinister Six]] and featured as one of the main characters in ''[[Superior Foes of Spider-Man]]''.

==Fictional character biography==
James Beverley is a race car driver who had dreams of being a superhero. When every attempt failed and he ended up in an accident, he gained the assistance of [[Power Broker]]. [[Mister Negative]] approached him and offered him a job in his criminal organization.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #39">''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #39. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Overdrive was hired by Mister Negative to steal an artifact from a museum, but was unable to deliver it because of interference from [[Spider-Man]]. Overdrive led Spider-Man on a high-speed chase through the streets of [[Manhattan]]. When Spider-Man smashed the windshield of Overdrive's car, it revealed dozens of pieces of Spider-Man-related merchandise such as bobble-heads, air-fresheners, and action figures. Overdrive declared that he was Spider-Man's "biggest fan", even asking for an autograph as Spider-Man was trying to stop him.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man: Swing Shift''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The chase finally culminated in a car-wreck that had Overdrive and his vehicle hanging from a bridge in New York by Spider-Man's webbing with Spider-Man's trademark note, "Courtesy of your friendly neighborhood Spider-Man". Overdrive asked the police who were on the scene to arrest him if he could keep the note. Overdrive was then sent by Mister Negative to steal the Sonic Pulse Generator from a laboratory but he failed again when he met Spider-Man once again. Mister Negative told his men to dispose of Overdrive and they put him in the trunk of Mister Negative's limo and Overdrive was able to escape them by converting the limo into one of his "tricked out" cars.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #642. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Ever since [[Menace (Marvel Comics)|Lily Hollister]]'s baby was stolen by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], Spider-Man had been going on a rampage against any villains involved. The police recovered a web ball containing Overdrive, [[Spot (comics)|Spot]], and [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #645. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Peter Parker later sees Overdrive kidnapping Terri Hilman, the daughter of a powerful socialite. Since his costume is dirty after the battle with [[Doctor Octopus]], Peter is forced to use a Halloween Spider-Man costume. Overdrive transforms the limousine he is driving into a copy of the Spider-Mobile. He then shoots Peter with webs pinning him into a wall. However, Peter manages to take Overdrive out from the car and leave him hanging for the police.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #647. Marvel Comics.</ref>

While working for [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]], Overdrive fought [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]].<ref>''Black Panther: The Most Dangerous Man Alive'' #524. Marvel Comics.</ref>

As part of the "[[Marvel NOW!]]," Overdrive was hired by [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]] to be a part of his version of the [[Sinister Six]]. Overdrive stole the original [[Big Wheel (comics)|Big Wheel]] vehicle and upgraded it through his powers. However, the [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] (Doctor Octopus' mind in Peter Parker's body) defeated Overdrive and the rest of the Sinister Six using a power dampening field that caused Overdrive's nano-bacteria to shut down.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Overdrive features as one of the main characters in ''[[Superior Foes of Spider-Man]]''. He secretly admitted that he only became a villain to gain a reputation, then planned to convert to the good side like Hawkeye.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The new [[Hijacker (comics)|Hijacker]] that fought [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Ant-Man]] and [[Falcon (comics)|Captain America]] in Miami claimed that his superpowers were derived from nanites that he acquired in New York from "some washout called Overdrive."<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Nick Spencer|penciller = Ramon Rosanas|inker = Ramon Rosanas|colorist = Jordan Boyd|letterer = VC's Travis Lanham|editor = Wil Moss|title = The Astonishing Ant-Man|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = 23 December 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

Overdrive later worked for Mister Negative again and became a getaway driver for his henchmen. Following a bank heist, Overdrive drove the Inner Demons away from the police. When one of the Inner Demons activated a weapon in Overdrive's car to use on the police, Overdrive continued to drive to the safehouse.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #39"/> While in their safehouse, the Inner Demons were attacked by a revived [[Sin-Eater]]. Overdrive took his car and drove away wishing that his attacker was [[Punisher]]. Overdrive raced for three days trying to avoid Sin-Eater.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #44. Marvel Comics.</ref> On the day where Spider-Man's dream predicted his death, Overdrive found Spider-Man and asked for his protection only to be shot by Sin-Eater. [[Carlie Cooper]] examined his body in the morgue when Overdrive somehow returned to life and found no bodily damages on him.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #45. Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to Sin-Eater having taken away his powers, Overdrive was placed on life support as Carlie keeps on eye on him. Following a fight with the [[Lethal Legion]] at [[Empire State University]], Spider-Man wonders how Overdrive can be in critical condition while everyone else that Sin-Eater "cleansed" were sent to Ravencroft.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 5 #46. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Overdrive scatters nanites by touch which can transform a vehicle to his will such as improving a car's speed or design. These changes will revert if Overdrive is away from the vehicle for too long.

==In other media==
Overdrive appears in the ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' episode "Bring on the Bad Guys" Pt. 1, voiced by [[Ryan Blaney]].<ref>{{cite episode|title=Bring On the Bad Guys Pt. 1|series=Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=33|airdate=July 30, 2018}}</ref> He is among the villains that take part in a mysterious person's bounty on Spider-Man. Overdrive lured him out by using his nanites on a bus which led to Spider-Man evacuating the bus. After being buried in Overdrive's trap where Overdrive took his glove, Spider-Man found a nanite sample which he used to work for him by powering up his Uncle Ben's motorcycle. When Overdrive returned due to needing Spider-Man's body, Spider-Man raced him in a motorcycle race which ends with Spider-Man using a virus in Overdrive's nanites to stop him. As Spider-Man webs up Overdrive, the police arrive as one of the police officers gives Spider-Man a ticket for speeding. Overdrive quotes "You'll get used to them" as he is taken away.

A female [[Marvel 2099]] version of Overdrive appears in the [[Nintendo DS]] version of ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]]. Her costume appears to be made up of nanites as her long white hair sticks out. She is also much more competent than her mainstream counterpart and claims she does crime simply because of the speed.
