During the ''[[Marvel NOW!]]'' event, another version is seen at a weapons expo that [[Daisy Johnson]] and [[Nick Fury, Jr.]] were attending. During the attack by [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] (Advanced Idea Mechanics) and their fight with the [[Secret Avengers]] (which [[Rebel Ralston]] gets killed), the [[Andrew Forson|Scientist Supreme]] of the A.I.M. High Council takes the opportunity to steal the armor.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #3</ref> The Iron Patriot armor was replicated and its low-level A.I. was grown considerably, creating an army of sentient Iron Patriot drones which A.I.M. used to incriminate the United States in numerous international attacks. When an army of Iron Patriot droids that were going to attack [[Iran]] appear, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] sent the [[Hulk]] to destroy the Iron Patriot droid army.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #4</ref> Using holographic communication, S.H.I.E.L.D. hacks into the A.I.M. network which allows Rhodes to talk to the Iron Patriot drones. Rhodes makes the Iron Patriot army understand their programmed actions are wrong, and states Rhodes could teach.<ref name="Secret Avengers 6">''Secret Avengers'' vol. 2 #6</ref>

During the "[[Inhumanity (comics)|Inhumanity]]" storyline, the Iron Patriot drones were disabled and badly damaged when the Secret Avengers were confronted by the vengeful Inhuman known as the Junkman's power of technopathy.<ref>''Secret Avengers'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Iron Patriot armor featured superhuman strength, enhanced durability, flight, magnetic impact blasts, heat seeking missiles, miniaturized lasers, flamethrowers, and a communications system housed in the helmet which allowed the suit to interface with any U.S.-controlled satellite or computer network. While Iron Man's armors utilized repulsor technology, the original Iron Patriot design did not as "[[Norman Osborn|Oz]] [was] too stupid" to make his own repulsor-based weapons system so the chest's star-shaped Uni Beam projector had a less powerful output.<ref>''Dark Reign: The List – Spider-Man'' #1</ref> However, the new Iron Patriot armor is a complete redesign that's an update of the previous model.
