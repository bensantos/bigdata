'''Yuri Watanabe''' first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #600 as herself, a captain in the New York Police Department (NYPD). The character was created by [[Dan Slott]] and [[John Romita Jr.]]

In ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663, a new Wraith appears, targeting [[Mister Negative]]'s criminal syndicate. During one such attack, the Wraith unmasks to reveal the face of [[Jean DeWolff]], later revealed to be a [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon mask]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #663</ref> It is later revealed that the Wraith is really Watanabe, pretending to be the ghost of DeWolff to scare the criminals she targets.<ref name="auto1">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #664</ref>

Wraith accompanies [[Carlie Cooper]] into going to Grand Taur√≥ where they chase Antoine Morant, a banker of notorious criminals, searching for information about the secret bank account of [[The Superior Spider-Man|Superior Spider-Man]] ([[Doctor Octopus]]' mind in Spider-Man's body). Carlie and the Wraith catch up with Morant, who was shredding some documents out of fear. Carlie catches the document, discovering that is actually all of the equipment and technology for the Arach-nauts and the order for his Spiderlings, all coming from the secret account of Doctor Octopus, putting Carlie one step closer to the evidence she needs to unveil the secret of Superior Spider-Man once and for all.<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #19</ref>

After Carlie is kidnapped by the Green Goblin, Yuri investigates Otto more hoping to find Carlie's whereabouts. She confronts Otto during the Goblin Nation attack for info on Carlie but is knocked out by the transformed Carlie. She then aids the Avengers and Cardiac against the Goblin Knight, and they are assisted by Spider-Man (who is now Peter Parker again).<ref>''The Superior Spider-Man'' #31</ref>

In the "Spiral" storyline, Yuri's faith in the justice system is shattered when [[Tombstone (comics)|Tombstone]] is released from prison after the crime boss was responsible for killing her mentor during a shootout between his gang and the police. She receives photographic evidence from Mr. Negative that the person who released him, Judge Howell, was one of Tombstone's customers and arrests the judge without contacting the CSI after obtaining more evidence as the Wraith with Spider-Man.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #16.1</ref> With a crime war looming in the local precincts, she continues to receive tips from Mr. Negative on where big crime overlords such as [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] and  [[Goblin King (comics)|Goblin King]] are meeting so she and Spider-Man can take them down.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #17.1</ref>

Spider-Man notices she is becoming more brutal in her approach and believes Mr. Negative is using her. He is later proven right when Mr. Negative begins to take over the turf due to the two-crime fighters taking out his competition and tries to frame her for murder. When Howell dies in prison from a stab wound, Yuri's chief ends her career for her quick arrest contributing to his death. After a fight with the Circus of Crime, she realizes she has been playing into Mr. Negative's hands and kills one of his men, claiming that Yuriko is dead while the Wraith lives.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #19.1</ref> When she attempts to kill Mr. Negative, Spider-Man tries to convince her to change her ways. She ultimately prefers no longer being bound to the law and fights her former ally to go after Martin Li, but Spider-Man knocks her out and goes on to defeat Mr. Negative himself. When he returns to the scene, he finds Yuri has abandoned her costume and taken the mask with her.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #20.1</ref>
